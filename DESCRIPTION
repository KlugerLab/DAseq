Description: DA-seq is a multiscale approach for detecting DA subpopulations.
    In contrast to clustering based approaches, our method can detect DA subpopulations that do not form 
    well separated clusters.
    For each cell, we compute a multiscale differential abundance score measure. 
    These scores are based on the k nearest neighbors in the transcriptome space for various values of k.
